        <h1>Our Donate Plan</h1>
        <p>The donations will be split and distributed in different ways, please state on your donation if you want it
            to go to a specific area (detailed below) or if it is Zakat money (I am having that distributed
            separately).My Maternal uncle who lives in Bishwanath Sylhet is in his late 60s and said he had never seen
            the likes of this flood in his life, the situation is much worse than he has ever seen before.

            All of your donations will go directly to the flood affected families, we are not taking any money for
            administration and everyone delivering the food is doing it on a voluntary basis.Above you can see my
            maternal cousin Saifur Rahman Sikdar , manager of EXIM bank Bishwanath delivering aid, he has been
            distributing aid provided by his Bank as well as what I have sent.

            As well as distributing food packs to poor families in my mother's home village of Elimpur, Bishwanath, we
            have a separate fund to help some people rebuild mud and tin houses that have been totally destroyed by the
            floods.
